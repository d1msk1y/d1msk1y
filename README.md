# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dima

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with more than **5 years** of hands-on experience, both as a solo developer and as the *first* Software Developer at Lehmann Elektro (just saying).

Throughout this time, I have delved into diverse projects spanning a wide array of languages and technologies. Without going deep into details, let's just say it equipped me with a profound grasp of universal programming principles, design patterns, and the art of getting things done in the most efficient and robust ways. 

At my current position I'm more of a fullstack developer, however my skillset and passion lean more into **backend development**, as I love to work on projects that reward solid understanding of software architecture, fast problem-solving, and logical thinking.

## ðŸ”§ Skills

```text
C#            | TypeScript  | Go            | Rust          | Python        | Bash 
Docker        | DevOps      | Linux         | Azure         |  Ruby         | Tauri                 
Ruby on Rails | JavaScript  | HTML/CSS      | C++           | PostgreSQL    | MongoDB 
```

I excel in **.NET**, **Node.js** and **Linux** development.  
I had used **Linux** as my main OS for more over a year, which had not only become integral to my workflow but had also given me the foundational knowldge of Bash scripting and other Linux components.

        <p>This project is a Rest API superset of various event-driven business-software automations of documents such as invoices, projects, customers, etc. For example (one of the automations), when one converts a project or a ticket into an invoice, the software API will call an automation event handler and forward some of the referenced document's data like: category, attached files, responsible employee, etc. All automation widely use our business software API, so I had to develop a kind of SDK for it, to make the code less repetitive, more cohesive and cleaner. </p>
