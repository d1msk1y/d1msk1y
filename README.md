# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dima
I'm a passionate Software Engineer with more than 4 years of hands-on experience. Throughout this time, I have delved into diverse projects spanning a wide array of languages and technologies, which equipped me with a profound grasp of low-level programming principles, design patterns, and the art of getting things done in the most efficient and robust ways. My skillset leans more into backend development, I love to work on projects that require solid understanding of software achitecture and logical thinking
## ðŸ”§ Skills

```text
C# | Linux | Go | Rust | Tauri | Bash | Docker | Python | TypeScript
PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Ruby | Ruby on Rails | JavaScript | HTML/CSS | C++
```
I excel in C#, Go, Rust(Tauri), and Docker.  
As my main OS, I tend to use Linux as it has not only become integral to my workflow but has also granted me a foundational knowldge of Bash scripting.
