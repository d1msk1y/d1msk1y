# 👋 Hi, I’m Dima

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with more than **4 years** of hands-on experience, both as a solo developer and as the *first* Software Developer at Lehmann Elektro. 

Throughout this time, I have delved into diverse projects spanning a wide array of languages and technologies, equipping me with a profound grasp of low-level programming principles, design patterns, and the art of getting things done in the most efficient and robust ways. My skillset and passion lean more into **backend development**, as I love to work on projects that require a solid understanding of software architecture, fast problem-solving, and logical thinking.

## 🔧 Skills
