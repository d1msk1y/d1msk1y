# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dima

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with more than 4 years of hands-on experience. Throughout this time, I have delved
into diverse projects spanning a wide array of languages and technologies, which equipped me with a profound grasp of
low-level programming principles, design patterns, and the art of getting things done in the most efficient and robust
ways. My skillset leans more into backend development, I love to work on projects that require solid understanding of
software achitecture and logical thinking

## ðŸ”§ Skills

```text
C# | Linux | Go | Rust | Tauri | Bash | Docker | Python | TypeScript
PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Ruby | Ruby on Rails | JavaScript | HTML/CSS | C++
```

I excel in C#, Go, Rust(Tauri), and TypeScript.  
As my main OS, I tend to use Linux as it has not only become integral to my workflow but has also given me a
foundational knowldge of Bash scripting.

                    <h2>Lehmann Connector (v2.0)</h2>
                    <p>A .net app designed to ease the handling of incoming calls for your On-Call Support by displaying the calling customer's info. Connector was initially integrated with 3CX, a business Phone System. However, the part I developed, which was released as an update, is the integration with Microsoft Teams and other miscellaneous features. Furthermore, I have almost entirely rebuilt the licensing of the app, by developing a dedicated Cloud Licensing Service hosted as an Azure Function App. I contributed to it in a team at @A-Lehmann-Elektro-AG</p>
